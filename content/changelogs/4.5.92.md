## Panel _(xfce4-panel)_

* Remove signal disconnect left after the patch of bug #4474.
* Fix xrandr problem so it's possible to change the panel's monitor after a monitor has been removed (bug #3620).
* Panel does not adhere to 'fullwidth' property when using vertical orientation after restarting (bug #4456).

* Implement support for the RestartImmediately restart style hint.
* Fix possible crash with uninitialised GError (bug #4202).
* Link libxfsm against all required libs to avoid link-time errors (bug #4429).
* Make splash engines store their settings in Xfconf.
* Handle the ProcessID SM property properly.
* Add a session editor to the settings dialog.
* Fix compilation on some Linux systems with a broken linux/ioprio.h header (bug #4515).

* Add SaveSession kiosk capability (bug #2998).
* When a client requests interaction, don't continue to kill all other clients while it's still interacting.  And then don't ignore it when it wants to cancel shutdown.  Also fixes a similar problem when interaction is requested during a phase 2 save-yourself (bug #4284).

## Settings Manager _(xfce4-settings)_

* Add an option to disable keyboard settings.
* Default to "Rodent" icon theme instead of "hicolor" (bug #4545)
* Use XfcePosixSignalHandler in xfce4-settings-helper to handle signals, since calling gtk_main_quit() from a signal handler may not be safe.
* Make xfce4-settings-helper connect to the session manager and use the SmRestartImmediately facility to make sure it keeps running. Disable the autostart .desktop file if we were restored from a saved session.  Attempt to acquire an X selection on startup to ensure multiple copies of the helper aren't running (bug #4577).

## Configuration Manager _(xfconf)_

* Add xfconf_channel_new_with_property_base() to restrict a channel to a subset of the property tree.
* Add a dbus message filter to xfconfd that catches dbus daemon disconnect signals and flushes channels before xfconfd gets killed (bug #4487).
* Change libxfconf GObject bindings API slightly to use gulong IDs for each binding to be used when removing bindings.  Extend the unbind functions a bit.
* Bump libxfconf interface version due to incompatible change.
* Add libxfconf perl bindings.
* Remove xfconf_channel_remove_property() and xfconf_channel_remove_properties().
* Only treat the XML file under $XDG_CONFIG_HOME as a "user" file, and treat all others as system files.  This fixes the problem where Xfce-installed defaults get read *after* the user's config when Xfce is installed to a user-writable prefix (bug #4592).
* Fix build on Cygwin and other platforms that actually care about library link order (bug #4559).

## File Manager _(thunar)_

* Add thunar-wallpaper-plugin for setting the wallpaper on xfdesktop >= 4.5.90

## Mixer _(xfce4-mixer)_

* Use xfconf_channel_reset_property() instead xfconf_channel_remove_property().

* Translation updates: Carles Munõz Gorriz (ca), Abel Martín (es), Maximilian Schleiss (fr), Andhika Padmawan (id), Terje Uriansrud (nb_NO)
