## Extension Library _(exo)_

The API version of exo has been changed from 0.3 to 1, to make it easier to  bump minor and major version numbers in future releases. To compile  against this version of exo, you have to change exo-0.3 to exo-1 in your configure file. This backwards-incompatible change has also been used  to remove deprecated APIs or APIs that are now provided by Gtk 2.14 or Glib 2.18.

Removed or incompatibly changed classes/enums/functions:

* Renamed exo_url_about_dialog_hook() to exo_gtk_url_about_dialog_hook().
* Exo(Mutual)Binding structures are now private.
* Removed exo_icon_view_{set,get}_{text,markup,pixbuf}_column().
* Removed ExoPangoEllipsizeMode and related functions.
* Removed exo_md5_*() functions and ExoMd5Digest.
* Removed exo_intern_string() and exo_intern_static_string().
* Removed ExoEllipsizedLabel has been entirely removed.
* Removed exo_gtk_object_ref_sink() and exo_gtk_radio_action_set_current_value().
* Removed exo_url_show() and exo_url_show_on_screen().
* Removed ExoMountPoint API.
* Removed ExoHal API.

New classes/functions:

* ExoJob and ExoSimpleJob for handling threaded/asynchronous jobs.
* exo_str_is_empty(), exo_str_looks_like_an_uri().

Other changes:

* GIO module for handling URIs that are known by the preferred applications framework.
* Only add sync mount option to devices with no volume.
* Use the GIO code for reading mount points in exo-mount.
* Make GIO-Unix an optional dependency.
* Fix the Python bindings (bug #6186,  bug #6187 and bug #6188).
* Add support for editing .directory files in exo-desktop-item-edit.
* Add desktop files for the exo-open types.
* Fix link problem with --no-add-needed (bug #5951).
* Add working directory support to exo-desktop-item-edit (bug #5692).
* Make the treeview work again with gtk 2.20 (bug #6230).
* Fix compilation error (bug #6421).
* Updated translations.

## Widget Library _(libxfce4ui)_

Initial version of the library. The intention of this new library is a cleanup  of the old libxfcegui4 library to remove the deprecated code and get rid  of netk (since 4.6 we use libwnck for that).

* New session management client.
* Improved code for spawing applications.
* New dialog functions.
* Support for glade-3's GtkBuilder implementation.
* New function xfce_spawn_on_screen_with_child_watch().
* Allow icon names in xfce_gtk_button_new_mixed().
* Add key binding to popup Xfdesktop menu (bug #4994).
* Fix bold labels in xfce_gtk_frame_box_new().
* Test if working directory exists before spawning command.
* Add startup notification support for shortcuts.
* Updated translations.

## Utility Library _(libxfce4util)_

* Fix broken translations in applications using libxfce4util (bug #5842).
* Performance optimizations.
* Improve xfce_expand_variables to expand ~ in more cases (bug #6742).
* Deprecate XfceDesktopEntry.
* Updated translations.

## File Manager _(thunar)_

* Replace ThunarVFS with GIO. All functionality previously based on ThunarVFS is now implemented on top of GIO and GVfs. This means that remote filesystems can be accessed via SFTP, FTP, SMB etc. For this as well as the trash feature GVfs is required. Thunar does not depend on it because GVfs is a set of GIO extensions and there is no guarantee for those to be available at runtime if they are installed at buildtime. This is left for distributions to set up properly.
* Thumbnails are now generated using the thumbnail management D-Bus specification. One implementation of this specification is Tumbler which is released independently.
* Bump the API version of Thunarx to 2 because symbols related to ThunarVFS were removed and replaced by new symbols dealing with GIO. This requires all existing plugins to be updated and linked against thunarx-2 instead of thunarx-1.
* Show "Network" item in the side pane and the "Go" menu if the <tt>network://</tt> URI scheme is supported by GIO (via an extension). Make the "Trash" item optional too.
* Use a single shared progress dialog for file operations instead of individual dialogs for each operation. The visual information in this shared dialog still has to be improved (work on this has been started in an experimental branch).
* Use g_utf8_strlen to calculate the side pane width (bug #3965, bug #5390).
* Add startup ID parameter to the BulkRename and LaunchFiles D-Bus methods in order to support startup notification over D-Bus.
* Avoid requesting drag data if the drag target is GDK_NONE (bug #5771).
* Add startup notification support to the custom actions plugin.
* Use install-exec-hook for installing the thunar symlink (bug #5835).
* Use libxfce4ui instead of libxfcegui4.
* Depend on xfce4-dev-tools >= 4.7.2 to get rid of custom configure code.
* Depend on exo-1 >= 0.5.1.
* Port the code related to thunar-volman to udev. This is an optional part of Thunar. The consequences are that instead of calling thunar-volman with HAL UDIs, we'll now call thunar-volman with sysfs paths. For this to work, a more recent version of thunar-volman is required: 0.5.0.
* Re-implement mount/eject notifications based on libnotify. Notifications were gone after the port to GIO because we no longer used exo-mount to mount or eject devices.
* Fix segfaults when loading image icons.
* Force a folder reload when the new_file closure is finished (bug #6409).
* Update the trash panel plugin to the new panel framework.
* Create status icon for file operations only when we're actually going to display it.
* Change current working directory before spawning applications in ThunarLauncher.
* Fix browsing shortcuts and mountables in ThunarLauncher.
* Synchronize ThunarListModel sorting with detailed list view captions.
* Fix sorting by type in ThunarListModel (bug #6143).
* Refilter the tree model when a hidden dir is entered/left (bug #6142).
* Properly update the cursor when a row is deleted (bug #5361).
* Use stock icons and standard icon names where appropriate (bug #6133).
* Move the trash panel plugin to $(libdir)/xfce4/panel/plugins.
* Move the <tt>LaunchFiles()</tt> D-Bus method to the <tt>org.xfce.FileManager</tt> interface.
* Remove README.volumes and ThumbnailersCacheFormat as those are specific to thunar-vfs.
* Display content type in the file properties dialog tooltip (bug #2369).
* Properly hide partitions that are not mountable by the user.
* Add new D-Bus methods: <tt>Execute()</tt>, <tt>CreateFileFromTemplate()</tt>, <tt>CreateFile()</tt>, <tt>RenameFile()</tt>., <tt>CopyTo</tt>, <tt>CopyInto</tt>, <tt>MoveInto</tt>, <tt>LinkInto</tt> and <tt>UnlinkFiles</tt>.
* Properly remember the default handler for a file / content type (bug #6167).
* Replace - with _ in parameter names of the D-Bus API.
* Do not display shadowed mounts.
* Provide an eject button for removable and present volumes in the side pane (bug #3658).
* Auto-select previously selected subdirectories when walking through the history (bug #5538).
* Delay applying the file selection until folders have finished loading.
* Fix broken compilation with -Wl,-z,defs and -Wl,--as-needed.
* Updated translations.

## Utilities _(xfce-utils)_

* Fix gpg/ssh-agent startup for users with pam_ssh installed.
* $dbuslaunch var isn't used anymore (bug #5863).
* Start ssh-agent before dbus so dbus has the env vars set.
* Port to libxfce4ui.

* Startxfce4 doesn't handle empty client options (bug #5382).
* Fix some bashism in xinitrc (bug #5557).
* Make xinitrc work with Solaris (bug #5557).
* Remove deprecated encoding key from desktop files.
* Add support for starting gpg-agent.
* Add ability to enable/disable or change the type of screensaver and ssh-agent using xfconf.
* Drop ck-launch-session as CK is handled in xfce4-session (bug #6684).
* Fix Alt conversion in migration script (bug #4811).
* Restore xfrun4's terminal checkbox state on launch.
* Expand command to handle ~ in xfrun4 (bug #4041).
* Use '#' as a shortcut to open man pages using xfrun4 (bug #5984).
* Save the command the user typed in xfrun4, not the expanded one.
* Fallback to exo-open when failure in xfrun4 (bug #4985 and bug #2506).
* Remove run argument feature in xfrun4.
* Fix handling of CLI arguments when opening in terminal with xfrun4 (bug #5478).

* Don't watch category changes in xfconf (bug #6043).
* Launch items with startup notification.
* Implement monitoring by reloading all contents on menu change events.
* Updated translations.

## Panel _(xfce4-panel)_

* Almost a complete rewite of the code. Everything is now  written in GObjects. This makes each individual part easier to  understand. All plugins are ported to GObject-based plugins and use  Xfconf for storing their information (apart from desktop-files of  launcher).
* Interfaces are all created by GtkBuilder.
* Ported to new Libxfce4ui (4.7.1) and Garcon (0.1.1)  libraries. Other dependencies include Gtk+ 2.14, Glib 2.18, Xfconf  4.7.2, Exo 0.5.1, DBus-Glib 0.73 and Libwnck 2.22.
* On first startup a dialog will appear to migrate old panel  config, start with the default setup or one empty panel.
* Panels can be dragged around the screen and snapped to every  panel edge. Each panel also has a setting to control the window length  (%).
* Possibility to lock panels. This will fix the position and hides the handles of the window.
* Alpha backgrounds.
* Item (plugin) editor in the preferences dialog, so you can  easily add, move, delete and edit plugins that are sometimes hard to  reach.
* Using Xfconf for storing the panel settings. Panels also  watches the Xfconf channel for changes, except for adding and removing  panels.
* New code for monitor/screen positioning. This should work a lot better with randr.
* DND of desktop-files on the panel to create new launchers.
* Possibility to add new plugins from the command line, including startup arguments.
* External plugins are automatically restarted if they have not  crashed in the last 60 seconds. If they crash more then once in this  time window, the user is asked what to do (restart or  remove).
* Gtk style properties for popup/popdown delay (bug #5707).
* Hidden option to disable struts for windows on a screen edge,  so the space is used by the window manager for other  windows.
* Plugin API should still be the same, however the ABI changed  so you need to recompile plugins against this version of the  panel.
* New way to run plugins compiled as modules externally.  Whether a plugin runs internal or external is controlled by a boolean in  the desktop-file of the plugin. This does not affect the 'old' external  plugins that are compiled as binaries, it is however recommended to  port plugins to this new framework (only Makefile and macro change)  since it is more flexible.
* Communication between the panel and wrapper (that embeds  plugins to run external) is handled through D-Bus.
* New way to build plugins as GObjects with XfcePanelPlugin as  parent type. This gives all advantages of GObject like type  checking.
* New settings dialog for the actions plugin  that allows one or two actions in the plugin in each order you want.
* New application menu plugin.
* New fuzzy clock mode and improved vertical orientation for the clock plugin.
* New directory menu plugin: menu that provides a directory  tree in a menu. It allows to quickly open a Terminal or File Manager for  some directory.
* Support to create a launcher from the command line with a number of desktop files as argument.
* New dialogs to configure launchers, with an application finder like interface to add new  applications and using the Exo item editor for modifying launchers.
* Button to quickly access the Xfwm4 workspace settings in the pager plugin preferences.
* Support for transparent tray icons (requires at least Gtk 2.16).
* Option to only show icons in the Windows Button plugin. This drops the Icon Box plugin.
* If the windows list becomes too crowded windows will show up  in an overflow menu, similar to what a menu bar does.
* Option to set the sort mode of the tasklist.
* Draw wireframe of the window on mouse hover, similar to the Alt+Tab wireframe in Xfwm4.
* Vertically orientated Windows buttons for vertical panels.
