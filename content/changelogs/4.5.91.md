## Development tools _(xfce4-dev-tools)_

* Don't try to patch intltool-merge.in for intltool 0.40.x: 0.40.4+ has a fix for the bug, and 0.40.x earlier than that aren't patchable as they run systemwide versions of the scripts.

## Panel _(xfce4-panel)_

* Add a D-Bus interface for some limited amount of remote control.
* Implement support for the ShutdownCommand SM property when a client has RestartAnyway set as its restart style hint.
* Implement support for the RestartNever restart style hint.
* sync() disks early in the shutdown process if on Linux and ioprio_set() is available (bug #4313).  Otherwise sync() right before quit as before (bug #4313).
* Check for a running gnome-keyring instance before launching a new one (bug #3007).

## Settings Manager _(xfce4-settings)_

* Add workspace name handling to xfce4-settings-helper.
* Add support for embedding dialogs into xfce4-settings-manager (based on the X-XfcePluggable and X-XfceHelpFile desktop file keys).
* Add embedding support to the accessibility, appearance, mouse and keyboard settings dialogs.
* Don't use g_hash_table_get_keys() which requires GLib 2.14 (bug #4377).

## Configuration Manager _(xfconf)_

* Remove xfsettingsd (moved to xfce4-settings package).  This removes xfconf's gtk+ dependency entirely.
* Add xfconf_channel_get() which returns an XfconfChannel singleton object that lives until calling xfconf_shutdown().
* Add xfconf_channel_reset_property(), which is a replacement for the 'remove' functions.  This more accurately describes what 'remove' actually does in the presence of locked properties and/or properties that have system-wide defaults.
* Deprecate xfconf_channel_remove_property() and xfconf_channel_remove_properties().
* Change D-Bus interface to reflect above two changes.
* Add IsPropertyLocked() to the D-Bus interface, as well as a corresponding xfconf_channel_is_property_locked() libxfconf function, which allows clients to query whether or not a property can be modified.
* Don't send out a PropertyChange signal if a property is set to the value it already held.
* Fix daemon crash when resetting properties recursively.
* Fix daemon sending incorrect property names in the PropertyRemoved signal when removing multiple properties at once.
* For GObject property bindings, if the bound xfconf property is removed from the config store, try to reset the GObject property to the default value specified in its GParamSpec.
* Add -R option to xfconf-query which causes the -r option (reset) to operate recursively to include all properties under the specified property.
* Add -a option to xfconf-query which forces setting a property as an array even if the array only has one element.
* Fix xfconf_channel_get_property() so it properly converts the value fetched from the config store into the type that the caller requested (if any).

## File Manager _(thunar)_

* Update Basque, French and Spanish translations
