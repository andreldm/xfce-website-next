---

## Utilities Library _(libxfce4util)_

* Updated translations: Szymon Kałasz (pl)
* New translations: Geraint Rowlands (cy), Jovan Naumovski (mk)

## Widget Library _(libxfcegui4)_

* Fix file conflict in xfce4-panel and xfce-mcs-plugins by moving the common icon xfce-filemanager to libxfcegui4 (bug #2033).

## Settings Manager Library _(libxfce4mcs)_

* Fix crashing g_ascii_strup() on 64bit platforms (bug #2563).

## Extensions Library _(exo)_

* Further clean up the ExoIconView code and add several small optimization.
* Import exo-mount utility to drop the dependency on other mount utilities, like pmount and gnome-mount, that don't work reliably, and were often the cause of trouble when mounting in Thunar.
* Add optional mount notify tool, which notifies the user that a device/media is begin unmounted by the system and gives a hint when the device/media can be disconnected/removed.
* Add exo-hal library, which provides several HAL related utility functions that have been deprecated in libhal-storage, but are required by several modules.
* Import ExoMountPoint module, which provides platform independent access to the configured and currently active mount points. This is required by other modules like exo-mount and thunar-vfs (for the trash implementation).
* Fix crash with certain kinds of discs (bug #2723).
* Detect complex mailto:-URIs properly (bug #2530).
* Fix compilation on amd64 (bug #2758).

## Window Manager _(xfwm4)_

* Use screen from xevent instead of client for keypress (bug #2749)

* Rework grab release (bug #2694)
* Fix display of ARGB32 windows with compositing enabled but without compositor active (bug #2710).
* Apply NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION changes (otherwise it breaks xfwm4 demand attention mechanism), but do not obey client state change requests for NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION if the client is already focused.
* Apply patch from Mike Massonnet that fixes an error in Stonage decoration theme (bug #2696)
* Do not apply NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION if client is already focused, as some apps seem to request NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION state even while focused (See comment #14 in bug #2678)
* Set the demands attention flag with focus prevention enabled only (bug #2678)
* Update the NET_WM_STATE when the client requests an update of NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION (bug #2678)
* Focus the internal fallback window when focus is transfered to a window that doesn't have InputHint set but  still use WM_PROTOCOLS_TAKE_FOCUS (ie, there is no way for the window manager to tell whether or not the client will accept focus in the end since focus is set by the client alone through the 'take focus' mechanism) (Fix bug #1853 without breaking bug #2410)
* Fix redraw problem with compositor
* Update application icon asynchronously to avoid queuing useless icon updates (Ubuntu/Launchpad bug #61424)
* Fix user focus timetamp being falsely reset to 0 causing some windows to be started un-focused (bug #2664), re-add some traces (which compile with -Werror this time), small code/api cleanup.
* Remove shadow on dock-type windows (bug #2648)
* Prevent fullscreen windows from beeing maximized (bug #2663).
* Use timestamp provided by NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW and NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP messages from EWMH version 1.3 and above, fix focus transition with NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP messages causing either flickering or wrong restacking on workspace switch (bug #2654)
* Quit nicely when MANAGE client message is received, so that xfwm4 obeys to ICCCM2 standard (bug #2374)
* Fix demands attention being activated when it shouldn't
* Improve focus stealing prevention.
* Auto-maximize regular windows only.
* Be a lot more paranoid about what broken apps set as struts.
* Plug a huge X resources leak in handleMappingNotify () (bug #2618)
* Do not prevent stick when skip taskbar is set
* Re-enable focus passing to previously focused window (req. on ML)
* Focus windows that raise themselves if focus stealing prevention is disabled, and set demands attention flag otherwise, that should improve focus prevention.
* Keep focus on sticky windows only for regular windows w/out skip taskbar/pager property (Bug 2603)
* Improve resize (bug #2597)

* Don't skip windows that have the skip pager/taskbar properties when searching for windows below the pointer (bug #2550)
* Fix focus transitionning to root taking into account the pending focus too, so that focus doesn't return to the fallback internal window when it should return to some other client window (like when an application closes with a modal dialog opened).
* Check for valid transient or modal when switching workspaces, to avoid missing windows to unmap (bug #2518).
* Use X server time to restore focus when sent to the root window (bug #2472)
