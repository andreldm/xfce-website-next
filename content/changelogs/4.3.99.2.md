* Keep the modification time when copying files (bug #2244).

* Make sure Thunar is restarted prior to xfdesktop, so the trash support in xfdesktop works as expected even if D-Bus autoactivation is not setup properly.
* Place automake options into configure.in.in instead of Makefile.am and add the tar-ustar option to fix building distributions on system where tar defaults to the deprecated V7 format (bug #2304).
