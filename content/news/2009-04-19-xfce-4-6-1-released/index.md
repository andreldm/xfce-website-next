The first bugfix-release of Xfce 4.6 has been released.

Thanks to all the people who have been using Xfce 4.6 and took the time and effort to submit bugreports for stuff that wasn't quite working the way it is supposed to. We have been able to fix several issues during the past few weeks.

Thanks to all the translators, several translations have been improved and completed since the release of 4.6.0.
