After almost two years of work, we are happy to announce the release of Xfce 4.18!

Since Xfce 4.16 a lot of major development happened. Our team added multiple nice new features, did a gazillion of bug fixes and did various minor improvements. Finally, all that is going to be released for your pleasure.

This development cycle was influenced a lot by <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/organizations/5706869816950784">GSoC 2021</a> and <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/xfce">GSoC 2022</a>, which led to various new features, most of them for Thunar, the Xfce File Manager. Though as well multiple other Xfce components got a lot of love and many improvements were done under the hood.

Assuming you have installed Xfce 4.16, here is an overview on the major changes you will see on an upgrade to Xfce 4.18:
