Whether it be to solve a problem or to contribute in any way, the Xfce communities are a good place to get help or to share your ideas. You might also want to have a look at the communities of the different distributions which provide Xfce.

## Mailing lists

Almost all development and coordination work is taking place on the Xfce mailing lists. A summary of all lists is available at [mail.xfce.org](https://mail.xfce.org). There is also a user-specific list where you can ask questions and freely discuss about the desktop.

**NOTE:** In order to post to these lists, you must first subscribe.

## Matrix

If you have a problem that you cannot resolve, you might want to try asking a question in our Matrix channel [#xfce](https://matrix.to/#/#xfce:matrix.org). The channel has several active users. It is recommended that you consult the [documentation](https://docs.xfce.org/) about your problem before asking your question.

## Forums

For users who prefer forums, the [Xfce Forum](https://forum.xfce.org/) is the place to be. Active contributors will be able to help you, but please do not use it for bug reports.

## Social Networks

You can follow us on the official [Mastodon account](https://floss.social/@xfce) or [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/xfceofficial).
