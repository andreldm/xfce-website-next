## Individual releases

Each package in Xfce can make individual stable or development releases, including the core packages (as described in the [release model](/about/releasemodel)). You can follow the announcements of the releases on the [Xfce users mailing list](/community/lists), watch the [release feeds](https://archive.xfce.org/feeds/project/) or follow the Xfce [Mastodon](https://floss.social/@xfce) or [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/xfceofficial).
