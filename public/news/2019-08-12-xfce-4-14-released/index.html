      <h1>Xfce 4.14 released</h1>

      <p>Today, after 4 years and 5 months of work, we are pleased to announce the release of the Xfce desktop 4.14, a new stable version that supersedes Xfce 4.12.</p>
<p>In this 4.14 cycle the main goal was to port all core components to Gtk3 (over Gtk2) and GDBus (over D-Bus GLib). Most components also received GObject Introspection support. Along the way we ended up polishing our user experience, introducing quite a few new features and improvements (read below) and fixings a boatload of bugs (read changelog).</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->main highlights of this release<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->window manager<!-- raw HTML omitted --> received a slew of updates and features, including support for VSync (using either Present or OpenGL as backend) to reduce or remove display flickering, HiDPI support, improved GLX support with NVIDIA proprietary/closed source drivers, support for XInput2, various compositor improvements and a new default theme.</li>
<li>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->panel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> got support for RandR&rsquo;s primary monitor feature, improved window grouping in the tasklist plugin (better UX, visual group indicator etc), a per-panel “icon-size” setting, a new default clock format and clock format evaluator as well as an improved default panel layout.</li>
<li>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> now has support for RandR&rsquo;s primary monitor feature, an orientation option for icon arrangement, a “Next Background” context menu option to advance the wallpaper and it now syncs the user&rsquo;s wallpaper selection to AccountsService.</li>
<li>A completely new settings dialog to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->manage color profiles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been created. For most users this means out of the box support for color-managed printing (through cupsd) and scanning (through saned). For monitor profiles you will have to install an additional service like xiccd.</li>
<li>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->display dialog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> received a lot of attention during this cycle and a big feature: Users are now able to save and (automatically) restore complete multi-display configurations, which is especially helpful for those who frequently connect their laptop to varying docking stations or setups. Furthermore a lot of time was spent on making the user interface more intuitive and a hidden option was added to support RandR display scaling (configured via Xfconf).</li>
<li>We added an option to enable Gtk window scaling to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->appearance dialog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a monospace font option as well. However we had to drop theme previews as they didn't produce consistent results with Gtk3.</li>
<li>While we decided to drop splash screens from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->session manager<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we added lots of features and fixes instead. Among them are hybrid sleep support, improvements to the default session startup avoiding race conditions, a feature to add and edit autostart entries, a switch user button in the logout dialog and improved session chooser and settings dialogs (the latter with a new tab that shows saved sessions). Furthermore you can now run commands not only &ldquo;autostart style&rdquo; at login time, but also when your computer suspends, logs out etc. Finally Gtk applications are now session-managed over DBus and screensavers are also communicated with (e.g. inhibited) over DBus.</li>
<li>As always, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thunar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - our file manager - received a lot of features and fixes. Among the visible changes are the completely reworked pathbar, support for larger thumbnails as well as support for a &ldquo;folder.jpg&rdquo; file altering the folder's icon (e.g. for music album covers). Power users will also notice the improved keyboard navigation (zooming, tab navigation). Thunar's volume manager has gained Bluray support.</li>
<li>Our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thumbnailing service tumbler<!-- raw HTML omitted --> received a lot of fixes and support for the Fujifilm RAF format.</li>
<li>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->application finder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can now optionally be opened as a single window and can now be more easily navigated with the keyboard only.</li>
<li>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->power manager<!-- raw HTML omitted --> received a lot of bugfixes and some smaller features, including support for the XF86Battery button and for the newly created xfce4-screensaver. The panel plugin also saw several improvements: it can now optionally show the remaining time and/or percentage and it now relies on UPower&rsquo;s standard icon names to work with more icon themes out of the box. With LXDE moving on to a QT base the LXDE panel plugin was dropped.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->applications and plugins<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are part of the Xfce eco-system - often dubbed &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; - are part of what makes Xfce great. A lot of those have also seen important changes along the timeline of the 4.14 release. To highlight a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->notification service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has gained support for persistence - in other words: notification logging - and a &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; mode, which suppresses all notifications. A new panel plugin was created that shows missed notifications (especially helpful during &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; mode) and gives quick access to toggling &ldquo;Do Not  Disturb&rdquo; mode. Finally support for showing notifications on RandR&rsquo;s primary monitor was added.</li>
<li>Our media player <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Parole<!-- raw HTML omitted --> received improved support for network streams and podcasts, as well as a new &ldquo;mini mode&rdquo; and automatic choosing of the best available video backend. Furthermore it also inhibits both screensavers and power managers during video playback now, making sure users don't have to go wiggle their mouse periodically while enjoying a movie.</li>
<li>Our image viewer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ristretto<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has seen various user interface improvements and support for setting the desktop wallpaper. It has recently also seen its first Gtk3-based development release.</li>
<li>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->screenshooter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> now allows users to move the selection rectangle and at the same time displays its width and height. The imgur upload dialog was revamped and the command line allows for more flexibility.</li>
<li>Our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clipboard manager<!-- raw HTML omitted --> now has improved keyboard shortcut support (through a port to GtkApplication), improved and more consistent icon sizing as well as a new application icon.</li>
<li>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pulseaudio panel plugin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> received MPRIS2 support to be able to remotely control media players and desktop-wide multimedia key support, essentially rendering xfce4-volumed-pulse a superfluous additional daemon.</li>
<li>And finally the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->terminal emulator<!-- raw HTML omitted --> saw a huge amount of bug fixes and improvements since Xfce 4.12.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a group of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new projects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that have become part of our project. Say hi to:</p>
<ul>
<li>We finally have our own <!-- raw HTML omitted -->screensaver<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (yes - we realize it&rsquo;s 2019 ;)). With lots of features and tight Xfce integration (obviously) it is a great addition to our catalog.</li>
<li>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->status notifier panel plugin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> provides a next-generation system tray where applications can show indicators. It supersedes the Ubuntu-centric xfce4-indicator-plugin for most application indicators.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Catfish file search<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is like an old friend for most Xfce users - now it&rsquo;s officially part of Xfce!</li>
<li>Finally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Panel Profiles<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which allows you to backup and restore your panel layouts, has moved under the Xfce umbrella.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always it&rsquo;s also time to say goodbye to some older <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unmaintained or deprecated projects<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. (Luckily our projects only go to the attic aka the archive on git.xfce.org when they die.) With a salty teardrop of sadness we bid farewell to:</p>
<ul>
<li>garcon-vala, gtk-xfce-engine, pyxfce, thunar-actions-plugin, xfbib, xfc, xfce4-kbdleds-plugin, xfce4-mm, xfce4-taskbar-plugin, xfce4-windowlist-plugin, xfce4-wmdock-plugin and xfswitch-plugin</li>
</ul>
