      <description>After almost two years of work, we are happy to announce the release of Xfce 4.18!&#xA;Since Xfce 4.16 a lot of major development happened. Our team added multiple nice new features, did a gazillion of bug fixes and did various minor improvements. Finally, all that is going to be released for your pleasure.&#xA;Xfce 4.18 screenshot This development cycle was influenced a lot by GSoC 2021 and GSoC 2022, which led to various new features, most of them for Thunar, the Xfce File Manager.</description>

      <description>Today, after 1 year and 4 months of work, we are happy to announce the release of the Xfce desktop 4.16, a new stable version that supersedes Xfce 4.14.&#xA;4.16 was a special cycle in many respects (not only pandemic-wise, but also). One of the corner-stones of the non-code changes concerns our migration to GitLab, which is a change in development workflow and a huge step forward in terms of becoming more contributor-friendly and welcoming.</description>

      <description>Today, after 4 years and 5 months of work, we are pleased to announce the release of the Xfce desktop 4.14, a new stable version that supersedes Xfce 4.12.&#xA;In this 4.14 cycle the main goal was to port all core components to Gtk3 (over Gtk2) and GDBus (over D-Bus GLib). Most components also received GObject Introspection support. Along the way we ended up polishing our user experience, introducing quite a few new features and improvements (read below) and fixings a boatload of bugs (read changelog).</description>

      <description>Xfce 4.12 is be the best release ever (yes, we like to party!)! Source: Internet comments.&#xA;Today, after 2 years and 10 months of work, we are pleased to announce the release of the Xfce desktop 4.12, a new stable version that supersedes Xfce 4.10.&#xA;This long period can only be explained by how awesome Xfce 4.10 was. But as all things, it needed some refreshing - and for that we saw lots of new contributors providing valuable feedback, features and bugfixes.</description>

      <description>Today, after almost two years of work, we have the special pleasure of announcing the much awaited release of Xfce 4.8, the new stable version that supersedes Xfce 4.6.&#xA;We hope that everyone will enjoy this release as much as we do. Sadly, this will not be the case as the folks using any of the BSD systems will notice a sudden loss of features. We think that this announcement is a good opportunity to express our disagreement with the recent &amp;ldquo;Linux-only&amp;rdquo; developments in the open source ecosystem, especially with regards to the utilities we need in desktop environments.</description>

      <description>Today we are pleased to announce the third and hopefully final preview release of Xfce 4.8 which is set to be pushed out to the public on January 16th, 2011. Compared to Xfce 4.8pre2 this release mostly features translation updates and bug fixes.&#xA;With christmas and new year&amp;rsquo;s eve between 4.8pre2 and 4.8pre3 it comes as no surprise that for most components only a few issues were tackled.&#xA;Among other things we updated the default keyboard shortcuts to include monitor keys.</description>

      <description>We are pleased to announce the second preview release of Xfce 4.8. This release marks the beginning of the string freeze. From today on until the final release, strings may no longer be changed in the master branch of Xfce core components. This will help translators to prepare their translations for the final release scheduled on January 16th, 2011.&#xA;For this release we focused on fixing bugs in all Xfce components.</description>

      <description>After more than two years of development, Xfce 4.6.0 has just been released.&#xA;Xfce 4.6 features a new configuration backend, a new settings manager, a brand new sound mixer, and several huge improvements to the session manager and the rest of Xfce&amp;rsquo;s core components.

      <description>The first bugfix-release of Xfce 4.6 has been released.&#xA;Thanks to all the people who have been using Xfce 4.6 and took the time and effort to submit bugreports for stuff that wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite working the way it is supposed to. We have been able to fix several issues during the past few weeks.&#xA;Thanks to all the translators, several translations have been improved and completed since the release of 4.</description>
